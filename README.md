# RajasthanHackathon3.0

<1>. Problem which we are addressing:-

Moneuments in Rajasthan is a mirror to our history, a way that connects us with traditions, ancient architects, extraordinary arts, 
culture and a lot more. Rajasthan attract a good number of tourists across the globe every year with a varied heritage and many iconic 
moneuments with artefacts from pre-historic to modern age revealing royalty, culture and the remarkable history.

The problem faced by tourist are plenty but one of the major problems are:-
1.Communication gap.
2.Improper guidance, unsatisfactory.
3.large number of touts who constantly try to shortchange the visitors and pestering them for money, which also create insecurity among them.
4.Children's and aged visitors cannot able to climb mountains or staired inside fords.
5.Hotel's room reservation for foreign tourists.
6.Lack of security etc.

So, our aim is to develop an user friendly mobile application which has features (like multilingual, AR/VR/MR, security etc.) that provides the best visiting experience for visitors across the world and uplifting the importance of tourism in Rajasthan.



<2>. Our proposed solution for this problem:-

We plan to make a mobile application which has many features such as:-
1.App will be in multilingual which support many national and international languages.
2.Gagalleries of all different moneuments and tourist places that are present specialy in Rajasthan with their details 
(like name, few line of description, related videos, location etc.).
3.App will integrated with AR/VR/MR which provide  mesmerizing and immersive experience of Virtual Tour of the entire moneument,
forts(inside & outside). Using VR, we can implement a virtual tour such that differently abled people can Rome around the entire 
fort or the monument or museum  without any effort. It will guide the tourist more efficiently, effectively and in a more amazing
manner than the human could have.
4.If they want to rome inside the fort physicaly then through our app with the help of one guide can sit at any place and guide 
them with real time commentary.
5.App will have a map integrated on it showing all the nearest torist place around their location so that they can plan for that.
6.We can also feed data about nearest hotels and guest house that will notify the user about hotels nearby, so there is no problem faced by tourists.
7.Security feature: It can help send message to nearest help Centre, medical, police station or tourist police automatically with their geo location.
8.App will also ask visitors information to create a database so that we can do analysis on that like 
	i.How many visitors visited this weak?
	ii.Most of the visitors are from which place?
	iii.In which month monument visited most?
	iv.What problem faced by most of the visitors?
9.App will have Feedback system where visitors have chooice to give their feedback(good or bad) so that Rajasthan government will try to improve.
